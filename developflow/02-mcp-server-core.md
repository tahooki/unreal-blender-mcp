# Phase 2: MCP Server Core Development

## Overview
This phase focuses on developing the core MCP server, which will serve as the central communication hub between AI agents and the target applications (Blender and Unreal Engine).

## Tasks

### 1. Server Framework Setup
- [x] Implement FastAPI application structure
- [x] Set up SSE (Server-Sent Events) endpoint at `/stream`
- [x] Implement basic request/response handling

### 2. Connection Management
- [x] Create abstract Connection base class for application interfaces
- [x] Implement BlenderConnection class (adapting from blender-mcp)
- [x] Create UnrealConnection class structure
- [x] Implement connection management and error handling

### 3. API Design and Implementation
- [x] Define common API interface for both applications
- [x] Implement API routing mechanisms
- [x] Create error handling and response formatting
- [x] Add request validation

### 4. Langchain Integration
- [x] Set up basic Langchain components
- [x] Implement memory/state management
- [x] Configure document processing capabilities
- [x] Create prompt templates for AI agent interactions

### 5. Tool Function Implementation
- [x] Define Blender tool functions (adapting from blender-mcp)
- [x] Create Unreal Engine tool function scaffolding
- [x] Implement common utilities and helper functions
- [x] Add input validation for all tool functions

### 6. Testing Framework
- [x] Create unit tests for server components
- [x] Implement mock connections for testing
- [x] Add integration test structure
- [x] Create test utilities for simulating requests

## Testing Procedures
- Test SSE connection stability and message handling
- Verify API endpoints function correctly
- Test Langchain state management with sample inputs
- Validate error handling across different scenarios
- Test connection management with mock clients

## Deliverables
- Functional MCP server with SSE support
- Connection management system for both applications
- API routing and request handling
- Basic Langchain integration
- Tool function definitions with validation
- Test suite for core functionality
