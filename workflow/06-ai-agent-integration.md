# Phase 6: AI Agent Integration

## Overview
This phase focuses on integrating the unreal-blender-mcp system with AI agents like Claude and ChatGPT, ensuring they can effectively control both Blender and Unreal Engine through the MCP server.

## Tasks

### 1. Tool Function Definition
- [x] Define comprehensive tool functions for AI agents
- [x] Create detailed descriptions for each function
- [x] Set up parameter validation for AI inputs
- [x] Implement response formatting for AI consumption

### 2. Prompt Engineering
- [x] Create effective prompts for AI agents
- [x] Design system messages explaining available tools
- [x] Create examples of tool usage
- [x] Define constraints and guidelines for AI interaction

### 3. Claude Integration
- [x] Set up Claude for Desktop configuration
- [x] Create Claude-specific tool definitions
- [x] Test Claude's understanding of the system
- [x] Document Claude-specific workflows

### 4. ChatGPT/Cursor Integration
- [x] Configure Cursor MCP settings
- [x] Create ChatGPT-specific tool definitions
- [x] Test ChatGPT's understanding of the system
- [x] Document ChatGPT-specific workflows

### 5. Error Handling for AI Interaction
- [x] Implement AI-friendly error messages
- [x] Create recovery prompts for error conditions
- [x] Add context preservation during errors
- [x] Test AI responses to various error conditions

### 6. Workflow Documentation
- [x] Create step-by-step guides for common AI-driven workflows
- [x] Document example conversations with AI agents
- [x] Create troubleshooting guide for AI interactions
- [x] Develop best practices for AI-driven 3D workflows
