# Development Plan for unreal-blender-mcp

This document outlines the sequential development workflow for the unreal-blender-mcp project, which aims to create a system allowing AI agents to control both Unreal Engine and Blender through a unified MCP server.

## Development Sequence

1. **Project Setup and Environment Configuration**
   - Set up project structure, dependencies, and development environment
   - Create configuration files and initialize repository

2. **MCP Server Core Development**
   - Implement basic SSE server functionality
   - Design and implement the API structure
   - Integrate basic Langchain functionality for state management

3. **Blender Addon Integration**
   - Adapt existing blender-mcp addon
   - Implement required endpoints and functionality
   - Test communication with MCP server

4. **Unreal Engine Plugin Development**
   - Create UEPythonServer plugin structure
   - Implement HTTP server in Unreal Engine
   - Develop Python code execution functionality
   - Test communication with MCP server

5. **Integration and End-to-End Testing**
   - Test full communication flow between all components
   - Verify functionality across different scenarios
   - Optimize performance and fix issues

6. **AI Agent Integration**
   - Configure system for use with Claude/ChatGPT
   - Define tool functions for AI agents
   - Test AI-driven workflows

7. **Documentation and Refinement**
   - Complete user and developer documentation
   - Refine error handling and edge cases
   - Prepare for release

Each stage has its own detailed workflow document that breaks down specific tasks, testing procedures, and deliverables.

## Development Principles

1. **Modular Testing**: Each component should be testable in isolation before integration
2. **Continuous Integration**: Regular testing of integrated components
3. **Documentation-Driven**: Write documentation alongside code
4. **Security-First**: Implement security measures from the beginning
5. **User Experience**: Consider the end-user (AI agent) experience throughout

## Progress Tracking

Each workflow document includes checkboxes for task completion and a log section for recording progress, issues, and solutions.
