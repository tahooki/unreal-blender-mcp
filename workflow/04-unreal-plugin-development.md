# Phase 4: Unreal Engine Plugin Development

## Overview
This phase focuses on developing the UEPythonServer plugin for Unreal Engine, which will enable Python code execution within the Unreal environment via HTTP requests from the MCP server.

## Tasks

### 1. Plugin Structure Setup
- [ ] Create UEPythonServer plugin directory with required files
- [ ] Set up plugin metadata in UEPythonServer.uplugin
- [ ] Define module structure for the plugin
- [ ] Configure build system for the plugin

### 2. HTTP Server Implementation
- [ ] Implement HTTP server on port 8500
- [ ] Create request handling functionality
- [ ] Implement endpoint routing
- [ ] Add security measures for local-only access

### 3. Python Integration
- [ ] Set up Python environment within Unreal Engine
- [ ] Implement Python code execution mechanism
- [ ] Create sandboxed execution environment
- [ ] Add timeout and resource limitation features

### 4. API Implementation
- [ ] Create `/execute` endpoint for code execution
- [ ] Implement request validation
- [ ] Add error handling and reporting
- [ ] Create response formatting

### 5. Unreal Editor Integration
- [ ] Create editor UI for plugin configuration
- [ ] Add status indicators for server state
- [ ] Implement logging in editor
- [ ] Create user feedback mechanisms

### 6. Testing and Security
- [ ] Create test scripts for plugin functionality
- [ ] Implement security measures for code execution
- [ ] Add crash prevention and recovery
- [ ] Create comprehensive error logging

## Testing Procedures
- Test plugin installation in a clean Unreal project
- Verify HTTP server starts and stops correctly
- Test Python code execution with various scripts
- Verify error handling with invalid inputs
- Test integration with MCP server
- Validate security measures for code execution

## Deliverables
- Functional UEPythonServer plugin
- HTTP server on port 8500
- Python code execution capabilities
- Editor UI for configuration
- Security measures for safe execution
- Test suite for plugin functionality
