# Phase 3: Blender Addon Integration

## Overview
This phase focuses on adapting the existing blender-mcp addon to work with our integrated MCP server, ensuring it can communicate properly and execute Python code within Blender.

## Tasks

### 1. Blender Addon Analysis
- [x] Review existing blender-mcp implementation
- [x] Identify required modifications for port change (7777 â†’ 8400)
- [x] Document core functionality and communication patterns

### 2. Server Component Adaptation
- [x] Modify socket server to use port 8400
- [x] Ensure backward compatibility with existing features
- [x] Implement updated request/response handling
- [x] Add enhanced error reporting

### 3. Core Functionality Implementation
- [x] Ensure all existing blender-mcp functions work correctly
  - [x] Scene information retrieval
  - [x] Object creation and manipulation
  - [x] Material management
  - [x] Python code execution
- [x] Add additional functionality if needed
- [x] Verify API compatibility with MCP server

### 4. UI Enhancement
- [x] Update Blender UI panel for server control
- [x] Add status indicators for connection state
- [x] Implement log viewing capabilities
- [x] Create user feedback mechanisms

### 5. Error Handling and Resilience
- [x] Implement robust error handling throughout
- [x] Add crash prevention mechanisms
- [x] Implement state recovery functionality
- [x] Create detailed logging for troubleshooting

### 6. Documentation and Testing
- [ ] Update addon documentation
- [ ] Create sample scripts for testing
- [ ] Document API endpoints and parameters
- [ ] Create test cases for all functionality

## Testing Procedures
- Install the addon in a clean Blender instance
- Test starting/stopping the server from the UI
- Execute all supported functions via API calls
- Verify error handling with invalid inputs
- Test integration with MCP server
- Verify Python code execution safety

## Deliverables
- Modified blender-mcp addon using port 8400
- Enhanced UI for server control
- Comprehensive error handling
- Documentation for setup and usage
- Test suite for addon functionality
