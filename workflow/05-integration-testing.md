# Phase 5: Integration and End-to-End Testing

## Overview
This phase focuses on integrating all components (MCP server, Blender addon, and Unreal plugin) and conducting comprehensive end-to-end testing to ensure the entire system works seamlessly.

## Tasks

### 1. System Integration
- [ ] Configure all components to work together
- [ ] Verify communication between MCP server and Blender
- [ ] Verify communication between MCP server and Unreal
- [ ] Test simultaneous operation of all components

### 2. End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Create test scenarios covering typical workflows
- [ ] Test Blender-only operations through MCP
- [ ] Test Unreal-only operations through MCP
- [ ] Test cross-platform operations (e.g., exporting from Blender to Unreal)

### 3. Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure response times for various operations
- [ ] Test under increasing load
- [ ] Identify and address performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize critical paths

### 4. Reliability Testing
- [ ] Test system stability over extended periods
- [ ] Simulate component failures and verify recovery
- [ ] Test with large data transfers between components
- [ ] Verify graceful handling of unexpected inputs

### 5. Security Validation
- [ ] Audit code execution security in both platforms
- [ ] Test boundary conditions and input validation
- [ ] Verify isolation of execution environments
- [ ] Test against common vulnerabilities

### 6. Documentation Update
- [ ] Update integration documentation based on testing results
- [ ] Document known limitations and workarounds
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Update API documentation with real examples

## Testing Procedures
- Set up complete test environment with all components
- Execute test suite covering all major functionality
- Perform both automated and manual testing
- Document all issues encountered and their resolutions
- Verify system behavior matches design expectations

## Deliverables
- Fully integrated and tested system
- Comprehensive test results documentation
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Updated system documentation
- Troubleshooting guide
